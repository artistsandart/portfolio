        <p>
        I was born in Panama City Beach, FL and moved around a lot growing up. The experience taught me a lot about different cultures and gave me the opportunity to experience different communities. Currently, I reside in Austin, TX with my two dogs. My BFA is from Rutgers University with a focus in film and video. I also hold an MFA from Academy of Art University. After taking courses in HTML5 and CSS3 from The University of Michigan on Coursera, I decided to enroll in the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin. I'm passionate about web development that is accessible and well designed.
